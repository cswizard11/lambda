### What, in your opinion, is an important part of code reviews? That is, what is something you pay attention to when you review code, and that you appreciate when others do the same for your code?

When I review code, I look for good documentation, readability, and general good programming practices that could be used, such as x += 1 instead of x = x + 1. When other's review my code I like them to look out for the same things.

### We have an awful lot of computers here, and it gets pretty confusing with slightly different things running on all of them. How could containers help us improve this situation?
